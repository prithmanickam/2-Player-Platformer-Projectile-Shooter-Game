# 2-Player-Platformer-Projectile-Shooter-Game
Coursework for OCR Alevel Computer Science. Recieved an overall grade A.
Was on track for full completion but project was unfinished due to school closure and exam cancelations from COVID-19. However, a majority of the required features were implemented in the latest iteration.

## Project aims and objectives
My project aims was to solve the problem of bordem and increase interest in gaming for students. Analysing serveys sent to 40 students in my school, I found most people enjoy action style games and interacting with another player, which lead to my idea of a 2 Player Platformer Projectile Shooter Game. 
I have chosen suitable stakeholder based on my survey so that I can get specific requirements and feedback for the problem I intend to solve. 
In an interview with my stakeholder, they requested a configuration option of time, rounds, sound, and music.

## Usage
My game uses the pygame library. It can be installed using: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
